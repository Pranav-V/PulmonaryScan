        Some notes:
            * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
            * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
            * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
                * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

          <p>. Smoking is the main cause of 84% of all lung cancer deaths, as well as 83% of all Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) deaths</p>
          <p>. COPD is a disease that will progressively debilitate you in more painful ways as you continue smoking. Effects of this disease include: breathlessness, persistent coughs, and chest infections</p>
          <p>. Frequent users of vape are susceptible to what is called “Popcorn Lung”. In this condition, a chemical that is frequently used in microwave popcorn (that is found in vapes), will permanently scar your Alveoli, or tiny air sacs in your lungs</p>
