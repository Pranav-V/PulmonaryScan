        Some notes:
            * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
            * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
            * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
                * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

          <p>. Smoking can lead to male impotence (inability to erect). This is caused by lack of blood flow to the penis because of damaged blood vessels which is a direct result of smoking</p>
          <p>. In the UK, 120,000 men in their 20's and 30's annually suffer from impotence as a direct consequence of smoking</p>
          <p>. Smoking also reduces sperm count and overall health of sperm</p>
          <p>. For women, smoking can lead to decreased fertility. Research has shown that women who smoke can be 3x more likely to take over 1 year to conceive than non smokers</p>
          <p>. Also smoking while pregnant for women can lead to many problems, some being: miscarriage, stillbirth/illness, premature birth, and 25% increase in cot death</p>
          <p>. Smoking can also increase chances of developing cervical cancer. Also, smokers are less able to fight HPV which can lead to cancer.</p>
